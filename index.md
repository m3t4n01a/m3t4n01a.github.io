## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="me_scaled.jpg">

Hi there. 
I am a Machine Learning guy, finishing my PhD at Imperial College London under the supervision of [Abbas Edalat](https://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~ae/). My current research topic can be very briefly summarized as "Hierarchical model-based deep reinforcement learning for trading".

## Research Interests
My other research interests *now* are in the domain of Deep Reinforcement Learning. I am interested in simple methods for non-parametric model-based reinforcement learning, semantic memory building from episodic memory using statistical properties of the environment, arbitrary hierarchical structuring of environments for planning, auxiliary reward functions, etc.

You can check out my longer story in the [About](/home/about) section.
